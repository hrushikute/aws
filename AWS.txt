Cross Region Replication : 

		-Management --> Replication
		-Once the replica is created only the new objects from the source bucket will be replicated. 
		-Exisisting objects will not be replicated.
		-Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets.
		-Regions must be unique
		-You cannot replicate to multiple buckets or use daisy chaining (at this time)
		-Delete markers are replicated.
		-Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.



Life Cycle Management, IA(Infrequent Access) S3 and Glacier :
	-Can be used in conjction with versionsing
	-Can be applied to previous verion and current version.
	-Actions performed
		-Transition to Standard IA (128k and 30 Days after creation date)
		-Archive to Glacier Storage Class(30 days after IA)
		-Permanently Delete.
